                <p>Hello,<br><br>Welcome to my personal site. Like all personal sites this is a place where the direct purpose is to showcase who I am as a person, my accomplishments, achievments, education, and more. So let's get right to the point, the usual way I introduce myself is that I am a mathematics student starting my junior year of college. This is true, but doesn't really give you a solid idea of who I am and what this "About" page is really about. The best way I have found to introduce myself is using my favorite quote, since it gives people a sense of who I am, rather than sounding like bullet points read off a resume. If you looked around the homepage of this site then you have already seen my favorite quote. The quote is by Einstein and reads, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Ever since I discovered this phrase in high school I have adopted it a sort of mantra for my life. This phrase hits home because, by nature, I am a perfectionist, a lover of efficient processes. I like to be neat, clean, and minimalist. The idea that something can be made simpler, smaller, and cleaner, while maintaining the same of amount of purpose is one of the most attractive ideas I can think of. Needless to say, I found my way into the technical fields of mathematics and computer science where efficient equations and clean code reign supreme. This is just a tiny peak into my life and who I am, but I hope you get a general sense of the kind of person I am.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Drew P. Worden</p>
